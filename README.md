# AI Gift Assistant Web Chat

This project is a web-based AI assistant that helps users choose the perfect gift for a birthday. The assistant asks a series of questions to understand the recipient's preferences (age, gender, interests, hobbies, budget, relationship with the giver, etc.) and then suggests original, personalized, and appropriate gift ideas. The assistant takes into account current trends, seasonality, and availability of items, and offers both material and non-material gifts (experiences, subscriptions, workshops, etc.). The assistant is polite, creative, and adapts to the user's communication style.
